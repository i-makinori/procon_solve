;;;; Search in Gradient stacked (memoed) Beam search method
;;
;; # about searching method
;; this searching method is derivertive of Beam Search method.
;; when beam reach to timeout (now, tis by n_step) or local solution(it is todo now),
;; restart beam which is chosen from gradient stored in stack.
