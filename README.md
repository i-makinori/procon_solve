![木組主之示申(ki kumu nushi no kami, or, ki kumun shi no kami)](./0kikunumushinokami.svg)

Afraid to say, He is the 木組主之示申(ki kumu nushi no kami, or, ki kumun shi no kami),  
is sitting downs to synthesized stones, is thinkingh how to solve puzzle into zero point.

shape filling puzzle.


# example usage

```sh
$ # call solver program by problem number
$ ./call-puzzle-solver.ros 3 
# ... solution messages ...
$ 
$ # or call it by problem file name
$ ./procon_solve/call-puzzle-solver.ros --problem-file some/directory/problems/puzzle_XX.txt
# ... solution messages ...
$ 
```
<!--
todo: not by number, by problem file name.

profile and tests are especially written in `src/flamegraph.lisp`, `src/profile.lisp`.
call functions defined there, you can also play artworks by this package.
